This Lab utilizes the City of Calgary's API to allow users to search through database for building permits. This lab utilizes Leaflet for the map and GeoJson to
access the API.

Once the broswer is opened, the map is zoomed into the City of Calgary.
Users can select dates using the calender feature to search through for databases issued during that time period. 
Users can zoom in on markers displayed on the map and select specific ones to view details such as Date Issues, Community name etc.
